CommandList2Command1Text1=Stats in Eclipse include Strength, Endurance, Agiligty, Intellect and Willpower. As you level up, you gain points. You can use these points in the character menu by hitting the "+" buttons to level up your stats and improve your character overall. For example, if you level up and spend a point on strength, you attacks get stronger and you kill monsters in less hits.

CommandList3Command1Text1=One last thing I would like to re-itterate. This is the final room of the demo. By now you should have received admin access from one of the other npcs in this demo, if you haven't I will make you one now. To begin creating your own game, simply delete the maps, spells, items, resources, npcs, shops, and animations from the server, restart everything and you will have a blank pallet to make your own game. Enjoy and thank you for playing.
